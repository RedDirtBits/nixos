# Dell XPS15 Production Configuration

In rather ineloquent terms, this just the configuration that is currently running and working on the machine.  I am probably going **way** overboard with the whole base, production, and testing thing, but it helps me keep everything organized until I can sort out some better method.  It would be really cool if such a mechnism existed within NixOS (well, I assume it doesn't anyway).  Yeah, I know, generations and all but what you end up there is a menu full of different generations that have no apparent meaning (because as far as I know there is no way to annotate them).

I mentioned in the [partitioning](https://github.com/RedDirtBits/nixos/blob/main/docs/002-repartitioning.md) that I did things a little weird in that I tend to do things in stages.  One of the reasons for this is that I like to take good notes on such things.  So my generations menu selection tends to grow quite rapidly as I try new thing and make micro steps so I can capture what I hope to be, useful information.  Don't be hatin' on me, I mentioned I was a little unconventional.

At any rate, this production configuration is where I hope to document most the the various changes I make along this journey and capture things like why is that needed, what does it do, when might it be useful.  You know, my normal bland, verbose stuff.  I mean, if you are having trouble sleeping and all...

# WARNING

I am still very much learning.  NixOS is forcing me, and I am happy to do so, to get somewhat into the weeds of Linux and its inner workings.  So what I add here as documentation may come from personal observation, experience, etc. or may other sources of information.  I say that to state that if you are here reading this (and still miraculously still awake) and see something that is not right, or have misunderstood, please be kind enough to let me know.  I am learning.  I will make mistakes along the way.  But I have two things I live by in such journeys:

> The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary

> Failure is inevitable.  The lesson is optional

I am willing to put in the work and I have no shame in making mistakes along the way, I just want to be sure I learn something from that.
