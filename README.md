# Introduction

My adventures in learning NixOS.

I am still working out the workflow, configurations, etc. so don't place too much stock in what you find here for now.  I am running everything in a virtual machine for now and have not installed to bare metal, yet.

Given the relatively sparse documentation around NixOS my starting goal is to utilize my _verbose_ nature and comment most conifgurations as if I were righting a novel.  Primarily because most documentation appears to make a awful lot of assumptions about the knowledge and skill of the reader.  This is all well and good, you have to start somewhere, but that often leaves out those that are curious, want to learn and/or are just starting out.

I don't have any delusions whatsoever this repository will be the solution to that, but, you got to start somewhere.
